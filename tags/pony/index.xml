      <description>A friend of mine jokingly brought up the Pony language in the context that he&amp;rsquo;s resigned himself to learn the language because his manager (also a mutual friend) is a staunch pony-phile (e.g., attended BABSCon, had a Rainbow Dash balloon floating above his desk at a previous job). At first I was intrigued: How many of the core designers are diehard bronies? Is this a legitimate language or just horsing around?</description>
