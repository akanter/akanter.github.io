      <description>Not to get too meta, I thought it would be appropriate to discuss my experience with Hugo in bringing up this blog. I generally followed the excellent quickstart documentation (which can also be very conveniently hosted locally).
Overall, I like the tool but as can be expected it has some interesting features which I thought were worth pointing out.
Shopping Around I did not do a tremendous amount of shopping around but I started with a few basic goals.</description>
